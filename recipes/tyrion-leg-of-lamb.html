  <h3>A juicy and cooked lamb leg, inspired by HBO's Game of Thrones</h3>
  <p>What better way to watch Game of Thrones than by devouring a recipe inspired by everyone's favorite imp. Just be careful not to call him that to his face or he'll set a dragon upon you.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>5 lb Leg of lamb</li>
    <li>1/4 cup Basil</li>
    <li>4 tbsp Garlic</li>
    <li>1/4 cup Golden raisins</li>
    <li>16 oz Spinach</li>
    <li>1 Salt & pepper</li>
    <li>2 tbsp Olive oil</li>
    <li>1/4 cup Pine nuts</li>
    <li>1/3 cup Goat cheese</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Remove the leg bone from the leg of lamb.</li>
    <li>Chop up your spinach.</li>
    <li>Toss your chopped spinach into a pan heated over medium heat, along with the olive oil.</li>
    <li>Add your minced garlic to the pan and sauté it until it halves in volume, which should take approximately 2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Mix your sautéed spinach and garlic from the pan into a small bowl.</li>
    <li>Add the pine nuts, golden raisins, and goat cheese to the bowl as well.</li>
    <li>Combine the ingredients well.</li>
    <li>Next, take the mixture of sautéed spinach, garlic, pine nuts, golden raisins, and goat cheese, and generously smear it on the inside of the butterflied leg of lamb.</li>
    <li>Roll up some foil and wrap it around your meat, just as you would with cooking twine. </li>

    <li>Place your prepared lamb into a roasting pan and transfer it to the preheated oven set to 350°F.</li>
    <li>Allow the lamb to roast for approximately one to one and a half hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 145°F. </li>
    <li>Once the internal temperature of your lamb’s leg reaches 145°F, it’s time to remove it from the oven. Let the leg rest for a minimum of 10 minutes before proceeding. </li>
    <li>After the rest, it’s time to slice the lamb, revealing its perfectly cooked and succulent interior.</li>
    <li>Serve the slices with pride, savoring the culmination of your culinary endeavors.</li>
